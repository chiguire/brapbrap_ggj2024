MAKE ME LAUGH

Would it be funny to have a competition with sponges that have vibration motors inside that make it slide around a surface.

It could be a cat trying to scurry around you, you look at it, it stops, you stop looking at it, it tries to get you. You have to catch it in motion.

However, I don't have all the necessary components to make something like that. I only have one vibration motor.

I did produce a funny video out of it, though.
