GLOBAL GAME JAM 2024
ATTEMPT #2
Theme: Make Me Laugh

You are: a parent, you are also a shapeshifter who doesn't have control of their ability. You sometimes are a charming creature, and other times you might look overwhelming or even scary.

Your baby will keep looking at you, but cannot find if you cover your face. So, by playing peek-a-boo, your objective is to make your baby laugh as much as possible.

Your baby has emotions, which we will put as a square:

v- Laughing  Curious -v
*---------------------*
|                     |
|                     |
|                     |
|          *          |
|        Neutral      |
|                     |
|                     |
*---------------------*
^- Confused   Crying -^

The face your baby makes is a function of where their emotions are in this chart. See accompanying picture for examples of how the face would look.

We'll use Godot 3.5 for this game. We will also use the Leap Motion plugin for Godot to use the controller. We'll use a 2D screen to draw the baby's face procedurally.

For this jam, the baby's face is made of these parts:

* A round circle, the head
* A box with curves, the mouth
* Two small circles, the nose
* Two medium circles, the eyes, with pupils
* Two lines that angle, the eyebrows
